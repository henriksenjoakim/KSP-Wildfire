# KSP-Wildfire
Add-on for Kerbal Space Program

This adds a pseudo fire simulation to the videogame Kerbal Space Program.

Overheating, bumping into things, crashing, pulling too many Gees(WIP) and other reckless activities may cause a fire to break out in subjected part. The fire will cause the part to gradually overheat. The fire may also spread to adjacent parts causing it to catch fire as well. 

No longer "Oh, I didn't really need that part anyway..." You really need the Primary Buffer panel to stay attached for the whole re-entry sequence! It may cause a leak, or a short-circuit, or general spontaneous combustion.

As commander of your sheep, you may want to install and herd your crew to your escape pods when you find your ship on fire and burning. A LES is also recommended. Indecently, the add-on also comes with a fire extinguisher system with built in extinguisher fluid, but it will cost both weight and power.

Planned features (may or may not come):

- Gameplay balancing.
- Integration with other hazardous mods (need to ask for permissions first).
- Weather hazards (when I can figure out how to make a toolbar interface).
- Atmospheric hazards.
- Crew skill based fire risk reduction (need to find a gameplay-friendly way to calculate the reduction).
- Ground Control skill based fire risk reduction.
- Fuel sparklers and water-based sound suppression (timing based mini-game) for reducing fire risk on launch (for encouraging a proper     countdowns).
