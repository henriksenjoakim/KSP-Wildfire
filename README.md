# KSP-Wildfire

This adds a pseudo fire simulation add- on to the videogame Kerbal Space Program.

Overheating, bumping into things, crashing, pulling too many Gees(WIP) and other reckless activities may cause fire to break out in the subjected part. A fire will cause the part to gradually overheat, giving only a few seconds until it disintigrates. There is also a risk that the fire may spread to adjacent parts, leading to an (unfortunate) chain reaction.

No more "Oh, I didn't really need that part anyway..." You really need the Primary Buffer panel to stay attached for the whole re-entry sequence! It may cause a leak, or a short-circuit, or general spontaneous combustion.

This add-on attempts to introduce less randomness in how failure (fires) occurs, thus a fire will never occur at total random, but can only be caused by something. This encourages taking proactive steps in order to reduce the chance of critical failure, as well as encouraging safe flying (who am I kidding?). 

As commander of your sheep, you may want to herd your crew to the pre-installed escape pods when you find the ship on fire and burning from enemy attacks. A LES is also recommended for launch. If you play with a life-support add-on, you may also want to pack potatoes and your stillsuit, in case your craft goes down on Duna...

Indecently, the add-on also comes includeded with a fire extinguisher system with built in extinguisher fluid (currently liquid CO2, until I can find something better), but it cost both extra weight and power (look for an RCS tank clone under Utilities). Once installed and activated, it will automatically try to extinguish fires that may occur on the craft. You can have more than one installed.


Required add-ons:
- ModuleManager (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-105-module-manager-2617-january-10th-with-even-more-sha-and-less-bug/)
- Community Resource Pack (https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/974/Community%20Resource%20Pack)

Planned features (may or may not come):

- Gameplay balancing.
- Integration with other hazardous mods (need to ask for permissions first).
- Weather hazards (when I can figure out how to make a toolbar interface).
- Atmospheric and deep space hazards.
- Crew skill based fire risk reduction (need to find a gameplay-friendly way to calculate the reduction).
- Ground Control skill based fire risk reduction (encourage hiring random staff).
- Fuel sparklers and water-based sound suppression (timing based mini-game) for reducing fire risk on launch (for encouraging a proper     countdowns).
- Weight increase for every part when fire extinguisher system is installed.
